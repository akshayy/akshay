As I reflect on my life, I want to be remembered as someone who lived a happy life, with purpose and dignity. Ralph Waldo Emerson's prose aptly summarizes my definition of such a life:

_"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people
and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics
and endure the betrayal of false friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better
whether by a healthy child, a garden patch,
or a redeemed social condition;
to know that one life has breathed easier
because you lived here.
This is to have succeeded."_

I aim to be the person that manifests each line of this prose, and more. Here is my vision for a well-lived life:

1. **Ownership of time:** I want to have complete ownership of my time, to be the sole decision maker of how I spend it. Being with my family is a priority for me, and I want to cherish every moment with them, celebrate their successes, and be present in their life journeys. 
2. **Health:** I aspire to be reasonably healthy. To me, this means having no major ailments and maintaining basic parameters such as weight, blood pressure, body fat, and BMI within the optimum range as I age. It would be fantastic to be in supreme shape for most of my life, but if that's not feasible, I strive to be reasonably healthy.
3. **Wealth:** I aspire to be reasonably wealthy, to have a lifestyle better than what I currently have. Accumulating enough wealth to not work for money but for purpose, and to provide my loved ones with a life of comfort, if not luxury, is a goal.
4. **Travel:** I want to travel more with my wife and daughter and show my daughter the wonderful experiences that the world has to offer. By doing so, I hope to expand her worldview and give her a deeper appreciation of different cultures.
5. **Giving back:** I want to give back to society by helping those in need. I aim to identify talented students from economically challenged background and provide them with scholarships. I believe that education is a powerful tool that can break the shackles of poverty and uplift families. By helping at least one person accomplish this, the impact will be significant.
6. **Exploration and learning:** I believe that I have not yet found my passion or purpose in life. Therefore, I want to continue exploring different domains, trying new things, pursuing various skills, and dabbling in multiple enterprises until I find that one purpose that I can devote my life to. If I discover my calling earlier in life, fantastic. But if not, I am still committed to living an extraordinary life by trying out different things.

I do understand that with time, my priorities in life may change, there may be circumstances that may not permit me to live life as I had planned but for now, I hope this vision acts as a guiding compass for me as I navigate life.
