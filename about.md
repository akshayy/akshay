Hi, my name is Akshay Deshmukh. I am a Product Manager with a Bachelors in Information Technology. I believe in putting my heart and soul in all my endeavours. I'm still in pursuit of that one thing that I can be deeply passionate and until then I try to nurture a deep passion for the jobs I undertake. 

Currently, I'm working as a Senior Product Manager at <a href="https://zinrelo.com">Zinrelo</a> where I help build a loyalty platform aimed at improving the retention rate for e-commerce retailers.

I read and write at whim but when I do I thoroughly enjoy it. If you feel I can be of help to you in any way , please feel free to reach out to me on <a href="http://in.linkedin.com/in/akshaydeshmukh16/">Linkedin</a>
